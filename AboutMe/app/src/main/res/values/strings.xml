        Hi! My name is Daniel PÄ™czek.
        \n\n
        I\'m a software developer in a TomTom. I graduated master degree\n
        in the field of the Computer Science. In my daily work I\'m working mainly in C++,\n
        but other technologies can\'t be a mystery to me.\n
        In my free time I\'m working mostly on ML and AI\n
        problems, but sometimes like now I\'m investigating new technologies.
        \n\n
        Apart of working on software engineering problems I\'m enjoying my time reading books\n
        (fantasy, science fiction, but also historical and classical ones)\n
        Also I\'m playing computer games a lot (especially RPG and complicated one\'s\n
        like Dwarf Fortress, KSP or Factorio).
        Also I\'ve started working again on painting Warhammer 40000 minatures.
